config.h:
*   NR_SCHED_QUEUES - unchanged
    
*   MAX_USER_Q = unchanged
    MIN_USER_Q = unchanged
    USER_Q = unchanged


schedproc.h
1*  unsigned tickets - added so each proc can track tickets.

2*  unsigned type - used to determine what type of process is
                    getting scheduled. 0 for system proc
                    1 for user proc

3*  Added TOTAL_TICKETS variable to keep track of tickets.

schedule.c

    int TOTAL_TICKETS = 0;
    #define SYSTEM_PROC 0
    #define USER_PROC 1
    do_start_schedule

    do_start_schedule
        case SCHEDULE_START
            .
            .
            .
            rmp->type = SYSTEM_PROC;
     
        case SCHEDULE_INHERIT
            .
            rmp->priority = schedproc[parent_nr_n].priority; --------> rmp->priority = MIN_USER_Q;
            .
            rmp->type = USER_PROC;
            rmp->tickets = 5;
            TOTAL_TICKETS = TOTAL_TICKETS + 5;


     
     balance_queues
        Changed the for loop
            if(rmp->priority != 16){ 
                if(winner_flag){  
                    rmp->priority = 17;
                }else if((running_total = running_total - rmp->tickets) <= 0){
                    rmp->priority = 16;
                    winner_flag = 1;
                }else{
                    rmp->priority = 17;
                }
            }
                     
    lottery(){
        Created:
        int winner;
        time_t t;
        srandom((unsigned) time(&t));
        winner = rand() % (TOTAL_TICKETS - 1);
        return winner;
